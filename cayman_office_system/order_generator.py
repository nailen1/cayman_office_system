The order backlog is steadily increasing, and favorable conditions (costs/FX) suggest consistent improvement in performance over the next 5 years. A cumulative profit increase of over 100% is possibled. In particular, IPO of the core subsidiary is expected within the next year. The target market cap presented by underwriters is at least five times the current market cap of the parent company, indicating a significant revaluation event is likely within the next year.",
    '282690 KS': "The company is set to merge with DN Automotive soon. Based on the merger valuation, the company's stock is currently trading at a discount compared to DN Automotive's stock, presenting an arbitrage opportunity.",
    '003030 KS': "The company is trading at a PER of less than 3, indicating extreme undervaluation. The marketâ€™s outlook on the future of the steel pipe industry is overly pessimistic. The current stock price does not yet reflect the upcoming operation of the UK offshore wind tower substructure plant, which is set to begin by the end of this year. The company is transitioning from a focus on fossil energy-related products to renewable energy products.",
    '271560 KS': "The company has been overlooked by the market due to its acquisition of a biotech firm focused on new drug development, which is unrelated to its traditional confectionery business. It is currently the most undervalued stock in the food and beverage sector. However, starting in the second half of the year, the company's core business is expected to see significant performance improvements, and the acquisition of the biotech company will gradually prove to have been a sound strategic move.",
    '000660 KS': "With the recent drop, PER has fallen below 5x, creating an attractive valuation opportunity. Concerns about AI investment are expected to ease after this fall. We have plans to engage to prevent profits and cash from being transferred to SK Holdings and its affiliates."
